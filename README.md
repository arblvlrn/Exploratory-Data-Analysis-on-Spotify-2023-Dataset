### What is an Exploratory Data Analysis? 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method of analyzing data, focusing on its main characteristics. This involves using statistical visualizations to help us understand the data better, detect errors, and test assumptions. It is one of the first steps before diving into more complex data analysis. 

### What is the goal of this deliverable? 

The goal is to explore and analyze a dataset of popular Spotify tracks from 2023. By examining and visualizing the data, we aim to uncover trends, popular artists, and other insights about the most-streamed songs. This will give a clear overview of the dataset and highlight key patterns. 

_____

Before starting the data analysis, I first imported the Python Libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn):

````
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
````

After importing the necessary libraries, I began by reading the CSV file to be used for the dataset analysis:

````
df = pd.read_csv('spotify-2023.csv', encoding='latin1')
````
Initially, I encountered a problem because the file was not encoded in UTF-8, the standard character encoding for many datasets. UTF-8 is often the default encoding when working with CSV files in Python, but some files may use different encodings, such as 'latin1' (also known as ISO-8859-1). Using the correct encoding (in this case, 'latin1') solved the problem, allowing the file to be read correctly.

## Overview of Dataet

In the first part of this analysis, we will focus on gathering basic information from the 2023 Spotify dataset. This includes finding the number of rows and columns, as well as identifying the data type of each column. This information is important because it helps us understand the structure of the dataset and ensures we can apply the right methods in the next steps of the analysis.

### How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?Â¶

To get the rows and columns of the dataset, I used the variable named 'shape'. By using the attribute of pandas '.shape', I was able to get the dimensions of the DataFrame easily.

````
shape = df.shape
print("Rows and Columns: ", shape)
````

### What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?

>>desc
 
````
dtype = df.dtypes
print("Data types of each column:\n", dtype)
````
>>>>result

>>desc

to get missing values:
````
missing_values = df.isnull().sum().sum()
print("Missing values: ", missing_values)
````
## Basic Descriptive Statistics

>>desc

### What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?

>>desc

````
mean = df['streams'].mean
median = df['streams'].median
sd = df['streams'].std

print("Mean:\n",mean,"\n\n", "Median:\n",median,"\n\n","Standard Deviation:\n",sd)
````

>>> result

### What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?

>>desc

````
#Create a variable for released_year and artist_count
released_year = df['released_year']
artist_count = df['artist_count']

#Create separate histograms for each variable
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))  #Input a figure size for a better visual

#Histogram for released_year
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  #Create subplot at position 1, 1 (top left)
plt.hist(released_year, bins=10)
plt.xlabel('released_year')
plt.title('Distribution of released_year')

#Histogram for artist_count
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  #Create subplot at position 1, 2 (top right)
plt.hist(artist_count, bins=5)
plt.xlabel('artist_count')
plt.title('Distribution of artist_count')

>>for outliers desc

````
#Create a box plot to identify the outliers

top_5_streams = df.nlargest(5, 'streams')['track_name']
print("Top 5 streams:\n", top_5_streams)
````

### Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?

### Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.

plt.title('Line Plot of Average tracks released per Year')

# Add labels
plt.xlabel('Released Year')
plt.ylabel('Average Track Count')
